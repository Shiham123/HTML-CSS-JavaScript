        It is completely OK to start from the beginning with HTML, CSS, or
        JavaScript coding. This video illustrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        syntax through the use of examples. The majority of projects are begun
        from scratch and completed without the use of any previously copied
        code.

        Perfect. Starting University in July and one of the courses is HTML, CSS
        and Javascript. Never coded before so quite nervous. Found your you-tube
        channel and have done the first project. It has improved my confidence
        level! Your pace in explaining everything was spot on. Simple programs
        that look amazing. I will now attempt to create a countdown timer with
        this basic knowledge then move onto your second project. Big thanks.
